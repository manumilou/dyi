Design and print of a custom lid for a Fluval Chi aquarium.
Printed with 2D laser-printer Glowforge.

## Material used

Clear cast acrylic 12"x12" 1/8" (3mm) thick ([Link](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B078NJ1Q9W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))

## Learnings
* Regular acrylic from the shop, 2mm thick, was badly warping after a couple of days. Probably caused by the heat.
* Shrimps are escape artists.
